      - case: package-copies-license
        prose: Package creation copies `LICENSE.txt` from source into the package.

        prose: >-
          Package creation copies a source file given to `addExecutable` in source directory
          into package directory with same relative path.

        prose: >-
          Package creation copies a source file given to `addExecutable` in build directory
          into package directory with same relative path.
  - group: addExecutable
    plan:
      - case: source-is-prereq
        prose: A source file given to addExecutable is a prereq of the output executable. When it updates, the executable needs to update, too.
      - case: multi-source-dev
        prose: Multiple sources can comprise an executable in a development build.
      - case: install-to-bin
        prose: When installed, an executable created with `addExecutable` is available in `<prefix>/bin`.
      - case: packages-generated-src
        prose: An executable that has a generated `src` file packages the generated file in the distribution.
      - case: findPackage-implicit-cmake-name-install
        prose: An executable with a `linkTo` a `findPackage(<name>)` finds a CMake package with that `name` and links to a library with `name`.

        prose: >-
          An executable with a `linkTo` a `findPackage({ cmake: <name>, ... })` finds a
          CMake package with that `name` and links to a library named `name`.

          An executable with a `linkTo` a `findPackage({ cmake: { name: <name>,

          links to a library named `target`.

        prose: >-
          An executable with a `linkTo` a `findPackage({ cmake: { name: <name>,
          libraryTarget: <target>, component: <component>, ... }, ... })` finds a CMake package
          with that `name` with a component named `component` and links to a library named
          `target`.

    plan:
      - case: installs-pkgconfig
        prose: A library installs a `.pc` file that links to the library with the same name as the library.
      - case: installs-cmake-config
        prose: A library installs a CMake config file that links to the library with the same name as the library.

        prose: After creating a package, source provided to `addTest` is not copied to the package.
